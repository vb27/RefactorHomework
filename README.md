-cut out redundant code in the style.css where the same line of code was used for multiple different places
-added alt attributes to all img
    -benifit-cost img has a redundant closing ("/img>"), removed
-added a class ("buttons") in the header to make it clear in the html and css what was being manipulated in the header
-changed class "hero" to "website-cover" to better understand what it was
-changed the list items in the header so it is easier to tell the individual items and how many there are
-changed title to Horiseon to be more specific than 'website'
-added an id to search-engine-optimization so that it correctly scrolls down when you click the button
-got rid of classes for the search engine, online rep, and social media to just id and changed the css to '#' from '.'
    -there is no need to have both class and id in this case.
    -I tried to have no id's at first but the button scrolling down broke
